oUF_Slim is based on oUF_Nivea and updated to work with oUF 1.5+ for WoW patch 4.x+ / Cataclysm.

r15
* TOC update for 4.1
* removed pet happiness
* added more PvP relevant auras to the whitelist filter (Throwdown, Skull Bash, Hungering Cold, Ring of Frost, Smoke Bomb, etc.)


r14
* improved mouseover highlight appearance
* tweaked raidframes
- added an option to set the maximum number of debuffs visible on raidframes (default: cfg.RaidDebuffNumb = 2)
- changed debuff and name position
- added Fear Ward to priest's class tags (red "FW")
* added experience and reputation info on player
- no plugin required, thanks to Hank for inspiration and animation code <3
- can be disabled via config (cfg.showXpRep)
- there's a delay of 2 seconds until rep/xp info will show on mouseover (player)
- the delay can be changed via config (cfg.delay)
- xp display is hidden at max lvl
- capable of tracking xp and rep at once

r13
* added some Cataclysm raid spell IDs to the aura filter list, thanks to breor
* removed Lady Deathwhisper's Frost Feaver spell ID from IC - since it keeps poping up from any ordinary Deathknight in PvP ...

r12
* changed background texture to a plain white one and increased alpha 
* tweaked player cast time position (should no longer overlap spell text with certain fonts)
* changed player and target default position
* added an option to change the aura size (default: cfg.buSize = 30)
* added an option to adjust the aura height	(default: cfg.buHeightMulti = 0.8)
- this option allows for rectangle buffs/debuffs, instead of just square ones
- set to 1 for square auras

r11
* changed folder structure
- made media folder separate, one folder to be used for all of my addons
- added alternative non-pixel font to dMedia: SF New Republic Bold.ttf ... works fine for everything, with THINOUTLINE and size 11+
* some tweaks to castbar time's font string Set Points
- should work better for different fonts
* added an option (hpNumbFS) to change the font size of health value (player, target, focus), independent from NumbFS (i.e. power value, etc.)
* added an option to enable/disable blizzards raidframe manager (disabled by default)
* improved raid frames
- splitted raid frames in 2 groups
>> cfg.RaidFrames = 25 people in group 1-5 and cfg.RaidFrames2 = 26-40 people in group 6-8
- you can separately enable/disable groups 1-5 and/or 6-8
- mana bar is now inside the healthbar and shorter
- increased default health height
- changed some things around
* cfg.PPyOffset is working again...
* class points font size is now also defined by cfg.ComboFS
* removed cfg.PlayerBuffsOnPlayerFrame option, as there are no player buffs since r1 ... oUF_Nivea leftover

note: 
The change to raid frame display means, that people in group 6-8 will not show up at all UNLESS your raid group is larger than 25 people. People moved to these groups will be hidden.

r10 
* changed how transparent mode works and thus got smooth healthbar updates working for it, too *yey*
* added options to change the healthbar color and alpha in Transparency Mode
* disabled smooth bar update for raid frames
* added Class Colors support, you can get it on WoWinterface (by Phanx)
- makes it possible to change class colors without taint, in game

r9 
* hide level when casting ...

r8
* fixed string error on level up
* changed AnyDown to AnyUp

r7
* embedded oUF_Smooth
* removed some reduntant variables from config
* added "Transparency Mode" - transparent healthbars, with class/reaction colored background. Besides looking nifty, it's especially nice for healers.
* added an option to enable/disable Transparency Mode - enabled by default

Note: The healthbar's filling/depleting won't be "smoothed" (through oUF_Smooth) in transparency mode, at least for now.

r6
* changed threat and debuff highlight appearance ... might be even final now :p
* changed, removed some name abbreviation code
- possibly fixed erratic name string error on level up *crosses fingers*

* added Evangelism/Dark Evangelism, Shadow Orb and Maelstrom tracking (Maelstrom is untested)
* fix error with TotemBar plugin
* updated TotemBar appearance
* smaller party health and mana value (name font size)
